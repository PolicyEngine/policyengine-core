# Variables

The `policyengine_core.variables` module contains the definition of `Variable`, which can have a value for each entity instance in a simulation, for each period in a simulation, dependent on the parameters in that period, as well as other entity instances.

## Variable

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: policyengine_core.variables.variable.Variable
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
    :show-inheritance:
