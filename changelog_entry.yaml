- bump: patch 
  changes:
    fixed:
      - Removed the possibility of a negative seed in random() within commons/formulas.py
    changed:
      - As part of the negative seed fix in formulas.py, a single seed and generator was used to generate a random sequence, rather than a random number generator and seed combination being deployed for each entity id. This saves around 5-10 seconds of computation.
