- bump: minor
  changes:
    changed:
    - Optimised enum encoding using searchsorted instead of np.select.
    - Optimised empty_clone using object.__new__() instead of dynamic type creation.
    - Added lru_cache to period and instant string parsing.
    - Vectorised random() function using PCG hash instead of per-entity RNG instantiation. Note that this changes random value sequences - simulations using random() will produce different (but still deterministic) values.
    - Added warning logging for invalid enum string values during encoding.
