# Data

The `policyengine_core.data` module is a new feature from the original OpenFisca Core fork. It provides a standardised class definition of a `Dataset`, which contains all the data needed to instantiate an OpenFisca simulation with nationally (or lower) representative data.

## Dataset

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: policyengine_core.data.Dataset
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```

## PublicDataset

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: policyengine_core.data.PublicDataset
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```

## PrivateDataset

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: policyengine_core.data.PrivateDataset
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```
